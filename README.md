# DSA

---

This repo has been made in order to track my DSA learning progress through saving solved questions ordered in patterns commonly observed on LeetCode

### 1. Fast and slow pointers

- question 142. Linked List Cycle II: Solved using Floyd's algorithm to detect cycle and starting point
- question 19. Remove nth node from end of list: solved using two pointer separated by the distance
- question 287. Find the duplicate number: solved using Floyd's algorithm to detect cycle
- question 234. Palindrome linked list: solved by reversing the second half of the linked list

### 2. Overlapping intervals

- question 56. Merge intervals: solved by sorting the starting interval and comparing the right hand side of the intervals
- question 57. Insert interval: solved by dividing the interval into 3 sections and inserting the modified newInterval into it's place
